# Triage Facility

Description: This implements heaps and methods to handle/manipulate these heaps. Then implements a triage facility service that takes in patients and treats them in order of priority, which is handled by using a heap. <br>
Features: There are 5 files that I implemented myself (Heap.java, HeapSortingGeneric.java, StringHeap.java, HeapSortingString.java, and TriageFacility.java). I also made use of Tuple.java and the Sorting.java interface. <br>
