1. PA Name: Triage Facility and Heaps
2. Description: This PA implements heaps and methods to handle/manipulate these heaps. We then implement a triage facility service that takes in patients and treats them in order of priority, which we handle by using a heap.
3. Features: There are 5 files that we implemented ourselves (Heap.java, HeapSortingGeneric.java, StringHeap.java, HeapSortingString.java, and TriageFacility.java). We also made use of Tuple.java and the Sorting.java interface.
4. Author: Samruddhi Hande
5. Acknowledgements: I used the PA Writeup, Zybooks, and looked up java documentation for the String class and definitions of heaps on Google to understand them and how they work. I also made use of a lot of Piazza posts to debug my PA.
